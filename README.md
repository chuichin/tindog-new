Some things to try to take note when redoing:

Font used is Montserrat and Ubuntu
Suggest to use more padding instead of margin.... quite interesting


## For completed example by Angela: refer https://www.appbrewery.co/p/web-development-course-resources


## Title Section
Add padding
1. Navbar
- brand to be clickable to the footer section 
- there's a toggler
- add padding

2. Description
- font color 
- put into columns btw text and pic
- pic rotate
- add buttons there beautify it and logo from Font Awesome
- later: image to stack behind the Feature Section partially at the bottom
- add abit padding at the bottom when image is position absolute already
- responsiveness: when tablet size, the phone goes to bottom and is back to original rotation, and everything is aligned center (use @media)

## Feature Section
- can use fa-4x for sizing
- when tablet size, take up whole row
- col
- add padding so that the text width is smaller n easier to read

## Testimonial Section
- practice in codeply first before combining
- take note of the data-target for control button to target the right carousell

## Press Section
- technically different section but put it nearer so that its like same

## Pricing
- responsive element: when full size, 3 col, md - first 2 is half half, and 3rd is full size, and sm - takes up whole


## CTA
- just follow pic

## Footer

- follow pic
